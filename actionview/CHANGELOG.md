*   Remove wrapping div with inline styles for hidden form fields.

    We are dropping HTML 4.01 and XHTML strict compliance since input tags directly
    inside a form are valid HTML5, and the absense of inline styles help in validating
    for Content Security Policy.

    *Joost Baaij*

*   `collection_check_boxes` respects `:index` option for the hidden filed name.

    Fixes #14147.

    *Vasiliy Ermolovich*

*   `date_select` helper with option `with_css_classes: true` does not overwrite other classes.

    *Izumi Wong-Horiuchi*

*   `number_to_percentage` does not crash with `Float::NAN` or `Float::INFINITY`
    as input.

    Fixes #14405.

    *Yves Senn*

*   Add `include_hidden` option to `collection_check_boxes` helper.

    *Vasiliy Ermolovich*

*   Fixed a problem where the default options for the `button_tag` helper is not
    applied correctly.

    Fixes #14254.

    *Sergey Prikhodko*

*   Take variants into account when calculating template digests in ActionView::Digestor.

    The arguments to ActionView::Digestor#digest are now being passed as a hash
    to support variants and allow more flexibility in the future. The support for
    regular (required) arguments is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.0 or later.

    *Piotr Chmolowski, Łukasz Strzałkowski*
