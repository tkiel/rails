*   Deprecate passing Rack server name as a regular argument to `rails server`.

    Previously:

        $ bin/rails server thin

    There wasn't an explicit option for the Rack server to use, now we have the
    `--using` option with the `-u` short switch.

    Now:

        $ bin/rails server -u thin

    This change also improves the error message if a missing or mistyped rack
    server is given.

*   Add "rails routes --expanded" option to output routes in expanded mode like
    "psql --expanded". Result looks like:

    ```
    $ rails routes --expanded
    --[ Route 1 ]------------------------------------------------------------
    Prefix            | high_scores
    Verb              | GET
    URI               | /high_scores(.:format)
    Controller#Action | high_scores#index
    --[ Route 2 ]------------------------------------------------------------
    Prefix            | new_high_score
    Verb              | GET
    URI               | /high_scores/new(.:format)
    Controller#Action | high_scores#new
    ```

*   Rails 6 requires Ruby 2.4.1 or newer.
