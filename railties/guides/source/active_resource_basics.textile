h2. Active Resource Basics

This guide should provide you with all you need to get started managing the connection between business objects and RESTful web services. It implements a way to map web-based resources to local objects with CRUD semantics.

WARNING. This Guide is based on Rails 3.0. Some of the code shown here will not work in earlier versions of Rails.

h3. Introduction

Active Resource allows you to connect with RESTful web services. So, in Rails, Resource classes inherited from +ActiveResource::Base+ and live in  +app/models+.

h3. Configuration and Usage

Putting Active Resource to use is very similar to Active Record.  It's as simple as creating a model class
that inherits from ActiveResource::Base and providing a <tt>site</tt> class variable to it:

<ruby>
class Person < ActiveResource::Base
  self.site = "http://api.people.com:3000/"
end
</ruby>

Now the Person class is REST enabled and can invoke REST services very similarly to how Active Record invokes
life cycle methods that operate against a persistent store.

h3. Reading and Writing Data

Active Resource make request over HTTP using a standard JSON format. It mirrors the RESTful routing built into Action Controller but will also work with any other REST service that properly implements the protocol.

h4. Read

Read requests use the GET method and expect the JSON form of whatever resource/resources is/are being requested.

<ruby>
# Find a person with id = 1
ryan = Person.find(1)
# Check if a person exists with id = 1
Person.exists?(1)  # => true
# Get all resources of Person class
Person.all
</ruby>
