h3. What Is The Asset Pipeline?

h4. Why Should I Use it?

Using the asset pipeline allows you to package JavaScript, CSS, or images with your Rails application, library, or plugin. It also makes it easy to create dynamic CSS with LESS and clean JavaScript with CoffeeScript to name a few of the popular preprocessors. The big difference is that they are now categorized in app/assets, treating them like first-class citizens instead of just throwing them into categorized folders in the public directory.
