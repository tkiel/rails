=== Storing Encrypted Files in Source Control

The Rails `encrypted` commands provide access to encrypted files.

=== Editing Files

`rails encrypted:edit config/encrypted_file.yml.enc` opens a temporary file
in `$EDITOR` with the decrypted contents of `config/encrypted_file.yml.enc` to
edit. The encrypted key is either stored in `config/master.key`
or `ENV["RAILS_MASTER_KEY"]` is used, but you can provide relative path
to the encryption key by using `--key` option:

`rails encrypted:edit config/encrypted_file.yml.enc --key config/encrypted_file.key`.

=== Viewing files

`rails encrypted:show config/encrypted_file.yml.enc` prints the decrypted contents of
`config/encrypted_file.yml.enc` file. The encrypted key is either stored in `config/master.key`
or `ENV["RAILS_MASTER_KEY"]` is used, but you can provide relative path
to the encryption key by using `--key` option:

`rails encrypted:show config/encrypted_file.yml.enc --key config/encrypted_file.key`.
