# Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
# You can use `rake secret` to generate a secure secret key.

# Make sure the secrets in this file are kept private
# if you're sharing your code publicly.

development:

test:

# This YAML file is processed by ERB first (as others). In particular the
# production environment can set the secret via an environment variable
# this way:
#
#   secret_key_base: <%%= ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE'] %>
#
production:
  secret_key_base: <%= app_secret %>
