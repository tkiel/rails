# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization.
# This file is for English, and is therefore named 'en.yml'. Add more files in
# this directory for other locales. Rails will automatically load every
# locale file in this directory.
#
# To use this location information, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, read the internationalization Rails Guide:
# http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html
