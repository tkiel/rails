*  Add `action_controller_api` and `action_controller_base` load hooks to be called in `ActiveSupport.on_load`

    `ActionController::Base` and `ActionController::API` have differing implementations. This means that
    the one umbrella hook `action_controller` is not able to address certain situations where a method
    may not exist in a certain implementation.

    This is fixed by adding two new hooks so you can target `ActionController::Base` vs `ActionController::API`

    Fixes #27013.
