*   Make URL escaping more consistent:

    1. Escape '%' characters in URLs - only unescaped data should be passed to URL helpers
    2. Add an `escape_segment` helper to `Router::Utils` that escapes '/' characters
    3. Use `escape_segment` rather than `escape_fragment` in optimized URL generation
    4. Use `escape_segment` rather than `escape_path` in URL generation

    For point 4 there are two exceptions. Firstly, when a route uses wildcard segments
    (e.g. *foo) then we use `escape_path` as the value may contain '/' characters. This
    means that wildcard routes can't be optimized. Secondly, if a `:controller` segment
    is used in the path then this uses `escape_path` as the controller may be namespaced.

    Fixes #14629, #14636 and #14070.

*   Add alias `ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile#to_io` to
    `ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile#tempfile`.

    *Tim Linquist*

    format block.

    Fixes #14462.

*   Append link to bad code to backtrace when exception is SyntaxError.

    *Boris Kuznetsov*

*   Swapped the parameters of assert_equal in `assert_select` so that the
    proper values were printed correctly

    Fixes #14422.

    *Vishal Lal*

*   The method `shallow?` returns false if the parent resource is a singleton so
    we need to check if we're not inside a nested scope before copying the :path
    and :as options to their shallow equivalents.

    Fixes #14388.

    *Andrew White*

*   Make logging of CSRF failures optional (but on by default) with the
    `log_warning_on_csrf_failure` configuration setting in
    `ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection`.

    *John Barton*

*   Fix URL generation in controller tests with request-dependent
    `default_url_options` methods.
