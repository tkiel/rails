*   `delegate_missing_to` would raise a `DelegationError` if the object
    delegated to was `nil`. Now the `allow_nil` option has been added to enable
    the user to specify they want `nil` returned in this case.

*   `truncate` would return the original string if it was too short to be truncated
    and a frozen string if it were long enough to be truncated. Now truncate will
    consistently return an unfrozen string regardless. This behavior is consistent
    with `gsub` and `strip`.

    Before:

        'foobar'.truncate(5).frozen?
        # => true
        'foobar'.truncate(6).frozen?
        # => false

    After:

        'foobar'.truncate(5).frozen?
        # => false
        'foobar'.truncate(6).frozen?
        # => false
