# A set of transformations that can be applied to a blob to create a variant. This class is exposed via
# the ActiveStorage::Blob#variant method and should rarely be used directly.
#
# In case you do need to use this directly, it's instantiated using a hash of transformations where
# the key is the command and the value is the arguments. Example:
#
#   ActiveStorage::Variation.new(resize: "100x100", monochrome: true, trim: true, rotate: "-90")
#
# A list of all possible transformations is available at https://www.imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php.
