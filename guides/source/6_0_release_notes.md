Upgrading to Rails 6.0
----------------------

If you're upgrading an existing application, it's a great idea to have good test
coverage before going in. You should also first upgrade to Rails 5.2 in case you
haven't and make sure your application still runs as expected before attempting
an update to Rails 6.0. A list of things to watch out for when upgrading is
available in the
[Upgrading Ruby on Rails](upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-5-2-to-rails-6-0)
guide.

Major Features
--------------

### Action Mailbox

[Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34786)

[Action Mailbox](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/6-0-stable/actionmailbox) allows you
to route incoming emails to controller-like mailboxes.
You can read more about Action Mailbox in the [Action Mailbox Basics](action_mailbox_basics.html) guide.

### Action Text

[Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34873)

[Action Text](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/6-0-stable/actiontext)
brings rich text content and editing to Rails. It includes
the [Trix editor](https://trix-editor.org) that handles everything from formatting
to links to quotes to lists to embedded images and galleries.
The rich text content generated by the Trix editor is saved in its own
RichText model that's associated with any existing Active Record model in the application.
Any embedded images (or other attachments) are automatically stored using
Active Storage and associated with the included RichText model.

You can read more about Action Text in the [Action Text Overview](action_text_overview.html) guide.

### Parallel Testing

[Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31900)

[Parallel Testing](testing.html#parallel-testing) allows you to parallelize your
test suite. While forking processes is the default method, threading is
supported as well. Running tests in parallel reduces the time it takes
your entire test suite to run.

### Action Cable Testing

[Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33659)

[Action Cable testing tools](testing.html#testing-action-cable) allow you to test your
Action Cable functionality at any level: connections, channels, broadcasts.

Action Cable
------------

Please refer to the [Changelog][action-cable] for detailed changes.

### Removals

### Deprecations

### Notable changes

*   The ActionCable javascript package has been converted from CoffeeScript
    to ES2015, and we now publish the source code in the npm distribution.

    This allows ActionCable users to depend on the javascript source code
    rather than the compiled code, which can produce smaller javascript bundles.

    This change includes some breaking changes to optional parts of the
    ActionCable javascript API:

    - Configuration of the WebSocket adapter and logger adapter have been moved
      from properties of `ActionCable` to properties of `ActionCable.adapters`.

    - The `ActionCable.startDebugging()` and `ActionCable.stopDebugging()`
      methods have been removed and replaced with the property
      `ActionCable.logger.enabled`.
