== Configure databases

Copy test/config.example.yml to test/config.yml and edit as needed. Or just run the tests for
the first time, which will do the copy automatically and use the default (sqlite3).

You can build postgres and mysql databases using the build_postgresql and build_mysql rake tasks.

== Running the tests

You can run a particular test file from the command line, e.g.

  $ ruby test/cases/base_test.rb

To run a specific test:

  $ ruby test/cases/base_test.rb -n test_something_works

You can run with a database other than the default you set in test/config.yml, using the ARCONN
environment variable:

  $ ARCONN=postgresql ruby test/cases/base_test.rb

You can run all the tests for a given database via rake:

  $ rake test_postgresql
