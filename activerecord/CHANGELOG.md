*   Log the sql that is actually sent to the database.

    If I have a query that produces sql
    `WHERE "users"."name" = 'a         b'` then in the log all the
    whitespace is being squeezed. So the sql that is printed in the
    log is `WHERE "users"."name" = 'a b'`.

    Do not squeeze whitespace out of sql queries. Fixes #10982.

*   Do not load all child records for inverse case.

    currently `post.comments.find(Comment.first.id)` would load all
    comments for the given post to set the inverse association.

    This has a huge performance penalty. Because if post has 100k
    records and all these 100k records would be loaded in memory
    even though the comment id was supplied.

    Fix is to use in-memory records only if loaded? is true. Otherwise
    load the records using full sql.

    Fixes #10509.

*   Fixture setup does no longer depend on `ActiveRecord::Base.configurations`.
    This is relevant when `ENV["DATABASE_URL"]` is used in place of a `database.yml`.

*   Fix mysql2 adapter raises the correct exception when executing a query on a
    closed connection.

*   Ambiguous reflections are on :through relationships are no longer supported.
    For example, you need to change this:

        class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
          has_many :posts
          has_many :taggings, :through => :posts
        end

        class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
          has_one :tagging
          has_many :taggings
        end

        class Tagging < ActiveRecord::Base
        end

    To this:

        class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
          has_many :posts
          has_many :taggings, :through => :posts, :source => :tagging
        end

        class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
          has_one :tagging
          has_many :taggings
        end

        class Tagging < ActiveRecord::Base
        end

*   Remove column restrictions for `count`, let the database raise if the SQL is
    invalid. The previous behavior was untested and surprising for the user.
    Fixes #5554.

    Example:

        User.select("name, username").count
        # Before => SELECT count(*) FROM users
        # After => ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid

        # you can still use `count(:all)` to perform a query unrelated to the
        # selected columns
        User.select("name, username").count(:all) # => SELECT count(*) FROM users

    *Yves Senn*

*   Rails now automatically detects inverse associations. If you do not set the
    `:inverse_of` option on the association, then Active Record will guess the
    inverse association based on heuristics.

    Note that automatic inverse detection only works on `has_many`, `has_one`,
    and `belongs_to` associations. Extra options on the associations will
    also prevent the association's inverse from being found automatically.

    The automatic guessing of the inverse association uses a heuristic based
    on the name of the class, so it may not work for all associations,
    especially the ones with non-standard names.

    You can turn off the automatic detection of inverse associations by setting
    the `:inverse_of` option to `false` like so:

        class Taggable < ActiveRecord::Base
          belongs_to :tag, inverse_of: false
        end

*   Fix `add_column` with `array` option when using PostgreSQL. Fixes #10432

    *Adam Anderson*

*   Usage of `implicit_readonly` is being removed`. Please use `readonly` method
    explicitly to mark records as `readonly.
    Fixes #10615.

    Example:

        user = User.joins(:todos).select("users.*, todos.title as todos_title").readonly(true).first
        user.todos_title = 'clean pet'
        user.save! # will raise error

    *Yves Senn*

*   Fix the `:primary_key` option for `has_many` associations.
    Fixes #10693.

    *Yves Senn*

*   Fix bug where tiny types are incorrectly coerced as boolean when the length is more than 1.

    Fixes #10620.

    *Aaron Peterson*

*   Also support extensions in PostgreSQL 9.1. This feature has been supported since 9.1.

    *kennyj*

*   Deprecate `ConnectionAdapters::SchemaStatements#distinct`,
    as it is no longer used by internals.

    *Ben Woosley*

*   Fix pending migrations error when loading schema and `ActiveRecord::Base.table_name_prefix`
    is not blank.

    Call `assume_migrated_upto_version` on connection to prevent it from first
    being picked up in `method_missing`.

    In the base class, `Migration`, `method_missing` expects the argument to be a
    table name, and calls `proper_table_name` on the arguments before sending to
    `connection`. If `table_name_prefix` or `table_name_suffix` is used, the schema
    version changes to `prefix_version_suffix`, breaking `rake test:prepare`.

    Fixes #10411.

    *Kyle Stevens*

*   Method `read_attribute_before_type_cast` should accept input as symbol.

    *Neeraj Singh*

*   Confirm a record has not already been destroyed before decrementing counter cache.

    *Ben Tucker*

*   Fixed a bug in `ActiveRecord#sanitize_sql_hash_for_conditions` in which
    `self.class` is an argument to `PredicateBuilder#build_from_hash`
    causing `PredicateBuilder` to call non-existent method
    `Class#reflect_on_association`.

    *Zach Ohlgren*

*   While removing index if column option is missing then raise IrreversibleMigration exception.

    Following code should raise `IrreversibleMigration`. But the code was
    failing since options is an array and not a hash.

        def change
          change_table :users do |t|
            t.remove_index [:name, :email]
          end
        end

    Fix was to check if the options is a Hash before operating on it.

    Fixes #10419.

    *Neeraj Singh*

*   Do not overwrite manually built records during one-to-one nested attribute assignment

    For one-to-one nested associations, if you build the new (in-memory)
    child object yourself before assignment, then the NestedAttributes
    module will not overwrite it, e.g.:

        class Member < ActiveRecord::Base
          has_one :avatar
          accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar

          def avatar
            super || build_avatar(width: 200)
          end
        end

        member = Member.new
        member.avatar_attributes = {icon: 'sad'}
        member.avatar.width # => 200

    *Olek Janiszewski*

*   fixes bug introduced by #3329. Now, when autosaving associations,
    deletions happen before inserts and saves. This prevents a 'duplicate
    unique value' database error that would occur if a record being created had
    the same value on a unique indexed field as that of a record being destroyed.

    *Johnny Holton*

*   Handle aliased attributes in ActiveRecord::Relation.

    When using symbol keys, ActiveRecord will now translate aliased attribute names to the actual column name used in the database:

    With the model

        class Topic
          alias_attribute :heading, :title
        end

    The call

        Topic.where(heading: 'The First Topic')

    should yield the same result as

        Topic.where(title: 'The First Topic')

    This also applies to ActiveRecord::Relation::Calculations calls such as `Model.sum(:aliased)` and `Model.pluck(:aliased)`.

    This will not work with SQL fragment strings like `Model.sum('DISTINCT aliased')`.

    *Godfrey Chan*

*   Mute `psql` output when running rake db:schema:load.

    *Godfrey Chan*

*   Trigger a save on `has_one association=(associate)` when the associate contents have changed.

    Fix #8856.

    *Chris Thompson*

*   Abort a rake task when missing db/structure.sql like `db:schema:load` task.

    *kennyj*

*   rake:db:test:prepare falls back to original environment after execution.
