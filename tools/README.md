## Rails dev tools

This is a collection of utilities used for Rails internal development.
They aren't used by Rails apps directly.

  * `console` drops you in irb and loads this local Rails repos
  * `line_statistics` gives lines-of-code counts for our codebase
  * `profile` profiles `Kernel#require` to help reduce startup times
